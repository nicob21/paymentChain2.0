            <hr>
            <p>Imagine a website that sell articles and wants to allow its clients to pay with ETH providing one account to each of them.</p>
            <p>The Master smart-contract can create new child accounts so the clients send ETH to them. Then the Master contract withdraw the funds of the children and can transfer it to its owner.</p>
            <p>Having one account for each client makes it easier to manage the incoming payments. Each payment is received on a different account that can be linked to a client.</p>
